The system will start a web server on port 8000. You can interact with it using HTTP requests.

### API Endpoints

- POST /process_text - Process text input
- POST /process_image - Process images
- POST /make_decision - Make complex decisions

## Example Usage

```python
import requests

# Process text
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/process_text",
    json={"text": "Hello, what can you do?"}
)
print(response.json())

# Process image
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/process_image",
    json={"image_path": "path/to/image.jpg"}
)
print(response.json())

# Make decision
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/make_decision",
    json={"context": "some context data"}
)
print(response.json())
```
